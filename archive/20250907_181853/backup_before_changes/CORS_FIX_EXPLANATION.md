# CORS Issue Fix - Persian Voice Assistant

## Problem Description

You were experiencing the following CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error:

```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000/api/health' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:

1. **Frontend HTML file** (`index.html` and `templates/index.html`) was making API calls to `http://localhost:5000/api/health` and other endpoints
2. **Backend server was not running** - No Flask server was active on port 5000
3. **CORS policy blocking** - When the browser tried to access a non-existent server, it triggered CORS preflight checks that failed

## The Solution

### 1. Started Backend Server

I created and started a simple server (`simple_server.py`) that:
- Runs on `http://localhost:5000`
- Implements all the required API endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/speak`, `/api/voice`, `/api/chat`)
- **Properly configures CORS headers** to allow cross-origin requests

### 2. CORS Configuration

The server includes proper CORS headers:

```python
# For Flask (if available)
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app)  # Enables CORS for all routes

# For simple HTTP server (fallback)
def end_headers(self):
    # Add CORS headers
    self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
    self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS')
    self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type')
    super().end_headers()
```

### 3. API Endpoints Implemented

The server now responds to:

- `GET /api/health` - System health check
- `POST /api/speak` - Text-to-speech functionality
- `POST /api/voice` - Voice interaction
- `POST /api/chat` - Chat conversation

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Server Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
# Returns: {"status": "healthy", "tts_ready": true, ...}
```

### 2. CORS Headers Verification
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:5000/api/health
# Shows: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

### 3. Frontend Test
Open `test_cors.html` in your browser to test all API endpoints with a visual interface.

## Files Created/Modified

1. **`simple_server.py`** - Minimal server with CORS support
2. **`test_cors.html`** - Test page to verify CORS functionality
3. **`CORS_FIX_EXPLANATION.md`** - This documentation

## How to Use

### Start the Server
```bash
cd /workspace
python3 simple_server.py
```

### Test the Fix
1. Open `test_cors.html` in your browser
2. Click the test buttons to verify all API endpoints work
3. Check that no CORS errors appear in the browser console

### Use with Original Frontend
1. Make sure the server is running (`python3 simple_server.py`)
2. Open your original `index.html` file
3. The API calls should now work without CORS errors

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:

1. **Install Flask properly**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors
   ```

2. **Use the full `app.py`** instead of the simple server

3. **Configure CORS more restrictively**:
   ```python
   CORS(app, origins=['http://yourdomain.com'])
   ```

4. **Add proper error handling and logging**

## Key Takeaways

- **CORS errors often indicate missing backend servers**
- **Always ensure your API server is running before testing frontend**
- **CORS headers must be properly configured on the server side**
- **Test with simple tools like `curl` before debugging complex frontend issues**

The CORS issue is now resolved! Your Persian Voice Assistant frontend should be able to communicate with the backend server without any cross-origin restrictions.
