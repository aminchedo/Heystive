cd /workspace/heystive_professional/heystive/models/
python3 unified_tts_loader.py

# Expected Output: 5 engines, 4 available, recommended: coqui
```

### Production Usage
```python
# Import unified loader
from heystive.models.unified_tts_loader import get_unified_tts_loader

# Get TTS system
loader = get_unified_tts_loader()
recommended = loader.get_recommended_engine()  # 'coqui'

# Use with existing TTS manager
from heystive.engines.tts.persian_multi_tts_manager import PersianMultiTTSManager
tts_manager = PersianMultiTTSManager()  # Automatically includes downloaded models
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Minor Issue: psutil Dependency
**Issue**: Unified loader has optional dependency on psutil  
**Impact**: Minimal - system works without it  
**Solution**: Install psutil or ignore (system functions normally)  

### Minor Issue: Piper Voices Failed
**Issue**: Piper Persian voices not available at expected URLs  
**Impact**: One engine unavailable, others work normally  
**Solution**: 4 other engines available, system fully functional
